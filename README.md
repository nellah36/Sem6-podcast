## Demo Overview

Watch the demo GIF to see the process in action:

1. The app opens and displays the main page.
2. You obtain a podcast RSS feed URL from sources like [Listen Notes](https://www.listennotes.com) or [Castos](https://castos.com/tools/find-podcast-rss-feed/).
3. You paste the RSS feed URL into the input field.
4. You click the "Process a Podcast Feed" button.
5. The app downloads the episode in MP3 format.
6. The WhisperX model transcribes the audio into text.
7. The ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo model then generates a concise summary.
8. Steps 5, 6, and 7 run on a GPU-powered backend deployed on [Modal](https://modal.com), while the summary and related details are displayed via a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) frontend.
